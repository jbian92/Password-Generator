I started this personal project to increase my understanding of web development using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

## Challenges Faced
### Reducing the amount of if-elif-else statements when determining the frequency of each different category of characters.
- **Problem**: Looking at all the if-elif-else statements in my code, I thought that there must be a simpler way to complete the same task. 
- **Solution**: After some thinking, googling, and trying out different ideas, I was able to successfully make my code more efficient and readable by implementing a list with the required categories checked off by the user and using a dictionary to store the required categories and their corresponding frequency. This also makes adding more category options easier in the future.
